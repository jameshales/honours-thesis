\chapter{Modal logic}\label{k}

In this chapter we will provide a sound and complete axiomatisation of the
refinement quantified modal logic, over the class of \classK{}. van Ditmarsch,
French and Pinchinat~\cite{french2010future} previously gave an axiomatisation
for the single-agent case of this logic. We extend these results with an
axiomatisation for the multi-agent case.

\section{Technical preliminaries}

In previous work, van Ditmarsch, French and Pinchinat~\cite{french2010future}
gave an axiomatisation of the single-agent variant of the refinement quantified
modal logic \logicKF{}.  The axiomatisation was formulated in terms of the cover
operator, $\covers$, an abbreviation which we defined previously. The
completeness proof consisted of a provably correct translation of formulae from
refinement quantified modal logic to basic modal logic, a translation which
relied on a disjunctive normal form, using the cover operator. Our
axiomatisation for the multi-agent refinement quantified modal logic relies on
the same disjunctive normal form, which we will define now.

\begin{definition}[Disjunctive normal form]
A formula in disjunctive normal form is defined by the following abstract syntax:
$$
\alpha ::= \pi \land \bigwedge_{a \in B \subseteq A} \covers_a \Gamma_a \bnfalt \alpha \lor \alpha
$$
where $\pi$ stands for a propositional formula, and for $a \in B \subseteq A$,
$\Gamma_a$ stands for a finite set of formulae in disjunctive normal form.
\end{definition}

To show that every \lang{} formula is equivalent to a disjunctive normal
formula, we first introduce the negation normal form and a corresponding lemma
for that form.

\begin{definition}[Negation normal form]
A formula in negation normal form is defined by the following abstract syntax:
$$
\alpha ::= p \bnfalt 
\neg p \bnfalt
\alpha \land \alpha \bnfalt
\alpha \lor \alpha \bnfalt
\knows_a \alpha \bnfalt
\suspects_a \alpha
$$
where $p \in P$ and $a \in A$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{k-nnf}
Every formula of \lang{} is equivalent to a formula in negation normal form,
under the semantics of \logicK{}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Similar to negation normal forms in propositional logic, we can recursively push
the negations inwards using the following equivalences:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\neg \neg \phi &\iff& \phi\\
\neg (\phi \land \psi) &\iff& \neg \phi \lor \neg \psi\\
\neg \knows_a \phi &\iff& \suspects_a \neg \phi
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{k-dnf}
Every formula of \lang{} is equivalent to a formula in disjunctive normal form,
under the semantics of \logicK{}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $\alpha \in \lang$. Without loss of generality, by Lemma~\ref{k-nnf}, we may
assume that $\alpha$ is in negation normal form. We prove by induction over the
structure of $\alpha$ that $\alpha$ is equivalent to a formula in disjunctive
normal form. The induction hypothesis is that every strict subformula of
$\alpha$ has an equivalent in disjunctive normal form.

The base case is when $\alpha = p$ or $\alpha = \neg p$ for some $p \in P$, in
which case we are done.

Suppose that $\alpha = \phi \lor \psi$. By the induction hypothesis, there are
formulae $\phi'$ and $\psi'$ in disjunctive normal form that are equivalent to
$\phi$ and $\psi$ respectively. Then $\phi \lor \psi \iff \phi' \lor \psi'$,
which is in disjunctive normal form.

Suppose that $\alpha = \knows_a \phi$. By the induction hypothesis, there is a
formula $\phi'$ in disjunctive normal form that is equivalent to $\phi$. Then
$\knows_a \phi \iff \covers_a \{\phi\} \lor \covers_a \emptyset$, which is in
disjunctive normal form.

Suppose that $\alpha = \suspects_a \phi$. By the induction hypothesis, there is
a formula $\phi'$ in disjunctive normal form that is equivalent to $\phi$. Then
$\suspects_a \phi \iff \covers_a \{\phi, \top\}$, which is in disjunctive normal
form.

Suppose that $\alpha = \phi \land \psi$. By the induction hypothesis, there are
formulae $\phi'$ and $\psi'$ in disjunctive normal form that are equivalent to
$\phi$ and $\psi$ respectively. Then $\phi \land \psi \iff \phi' \land \psi'$.
As $\phi'$ and $\psi'$ are in disjunctive normal form, then $\phi' = \delta_1
\lor \cdots \lor \delta_m$ and $\psi' = \gamma_1 \lor \cdots \lor \gamma_m$ for
some $m, n \geq 0$, where each of the $\delta_i$ and $\gamma_i$ are terms of the
form $\pi \land \bigwedge_{a \in B \subseteq A} \covers_a \Gamma_a$.  Then we
can rewrite $\alpha$ as a disjunction of conjunctions, by the following
equivalence:
$$
\phi' \land \psi' \iff \bigvee_{i \leq m, j \leq n} \delta_i \land \gamma_j
$$

For each $i \leq m$ and $j \leq n$, we have that $\delta_i = \pi \land
\bigwedge_{a \in B \subseteq A} \covers_a \Gamma_a$, and $\gamma_j = \rho \land
\bigwedge_{a \in C \subseteq A} \covers_a \Gamma'_a$, where $\pi$ and $\rho$ are
propositional formulae, and each $\Gamma_a$ and $\Gamma'_a$ is a set of
disjunctive normal formulae. Then we can write each conjunction as: 
$$\delta_i \land \gamma_i \iff (\pi \land \rho) \land \bigwedge_{a \in B
\subseteq A} \covers_a \Gamma_a \land \bigwedge_{a \in C \subseteq A} \covers_a
\Gamma'_a$$

We note that the sets of agents $B$ and $C$ may intersect, and hence the same
agent may appear in each of those sets, possibly with different sets of formulae
$\Gamma_a$ and $\Gamma'_a$. We can combine the two sets of formulae into one, so
that each agent appears only once, using the following equivalence:
$$
\covers_a \Gamma \land \covers_a \Gamma' \equiv 
\covers_a \big( 
\{ \gamma \land \bigvee_{\gamma' \in \Gamma'} \gamma' \mid \gamma \in \Gamma \}
\cup
\{ \gamma' \land \bigvee_{\gamma \in \Gamma} \gamma \mid \gamma' \in \Gamma' \}
\big)
$$
We note that as each $\gamma \in \Gamma$ and $\gamma' \in \Gamma'$ are assumed
to be disjunctive normal formulae, that applying a disjunction over each of
these sets yields a disjunctive normal formula. Conjoining two disjunctive
normal formulae does not yield a disjunctive normal formula, however an
inductive argument can be used to show that recursively applying the same
translation described here, to each of these conjunctions, yields a disjunctive
normal formula.

Repeating this for each disjunct in our original formula leaves us with a
formula in cover logic disjunctive normal form.

Therefore every formula of \lang{} is equivalent to a formula in disjunctive
normal form.
\end{proof}

We note that, similar to disjunctive normal forms in propositional logic, the
translation into disjunctive normal form in modal logic results in a formula
that is exponentially larger than the original formula in the worst case.

\section{Axiomatisation}

We provide an axiomatisation of the multi-agent refinement quantified modal
logic, \logicKF{}, and prove its soundness and completeness.

\begin{definition}[Axiomatisation \axiomKF]
The axiomatisation \axiomKF{} is a substitution schema consisting of the
following axioms:
$$
\begin{array}{rl}
{\bf P} & \text{All propositional tautologies}\\
{\bf K} & \knows (\phi \implies \psi) \implies \knows \phi \implies \knows
\psi\\
{\bf R} & \allrefs_a (\phi \implies \psi) \implies \allrefs_a \phi \implies
\allrefs_a \psi\\
{\bf RP} & \allrefs_a \alpha \iff \alpha \text{ where $\alpha$ is a
propositional formula}\\
{\bf RComm} & \somerefs_a \covers_b \Gamma \iff \covers_b \{\somerefs_a \gamma
\mid \gamma \in \Gamma\} \text{ where $a \neq b$}\\
{\bf RDist} & \bigwedge_{b \in B} \somerefs_a \covers_b \Gamma_b \implies
\somerefs_a \bigwedge_{b \in B} \covers_b \Gamma_b \text{ where $B \subseteq A$}\\
{\bf RK} & \somerefs_a \covers_a \Gamma \iff \bigwedge_{\gamma \in \Gamma}
\suspects_a \somerefs_a \gamma\\
\end{array}
$$

Along with the rules:
$$
\begin{array}{rl}
{\bf MP} & \text{From $\proves \phi \implies \psi$ and $\proves \phi$, infer
$\proves \psi$}\\
{\bf NecK} & \text{From $\proves \phi$ infer $\proves \knows_a \phi$}\\
{\bf NecR} & \text{From $\proves \phi$ infer $\proves \allrefs_a \phi$}
\end{array}
$$
\end{definition}

% TODO - compare to single-agent axiomatisation
The axiomatisation \axiomKF{} shares many of the axioms and rules of the
axiomatisation from the single-agent case. The axioms {\bf P}, {\bf K}, {\bf R},
{\bf RP} and {\bf RK}, and the rules {\bf MP}, {\bf NecK} and {\bf NecR} are
essentially the same as the axioms that van Ditmarsch, French and
Pinchinat~\cite{french2010future} used in the single-agent case. The differences
are that \axiomKF{} contains axioms for handling the interaction between
multiple agents. The axioms {\bf RComm} and {\bf RDist} are novel axioms used to
handle the situation where a refinement quantifier is applied to a cover
operator of a different agent, and where a refinement quantifier is applied to a
conjunction of cover operators belonging to different agents.

We will now show that the axiomatisation is sound with respect to \classK{}
models.

\begin{lemma}\label{k-sound}
The axiomatisation \axiomKF{} is sound for the class of \classK{} models.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The soundness of the axioms {\bf P}, and {\bf K}, and the rules {\bf MP} and
{\bf NecK} can be shown by the same reasoning used to show that they are sound
in basic modal logic. As the axioms {\bf RP} and {\bf R}, and the rule {\bf
NecR} involve only a single agent, their soundness can be shown by the same
reasoning used to how that they are sound in the single-agent refinement
quantified modal logic~\cite{french2010future}.

All that remains to be shown is the soundness of {\bf RK}, {\bf RComm}, and {\bf
RDist}.

\paragraph{RK}
Suppose that $M_s \in \classK$ is a Kripke model such that $M_s \entails
\bigwedge_{\gamma \in \Gamma} \suspects_a \somerefs_a \gamma$.

We need to show that $M_s \entails \somerefs_a \covers_a \Gamma$. To do this we
will construct a model $N_t \in \classK$, construct an $a$-simulation from $N_t$
to $M_s$ to show that $N_t \refinement_a M_s$, and finally show that $N_t
\entails \covers_a \Gamma$.

We begin by constructing the model $N_t$. Consider $\gamma \in \Gamma$. From
$M_s \entails \suspects_a \somerefs_a \gamma$, there exists a state $s^\gamma
\in sR^M$ such that $M_{s^\gamma} \entails \somerefs_a \gamma$. Therefore there
exists a Kripke model $N^\gamma_{t^\gamma} \refinement_a M_{s^\gamma}$, via some
$a$-simulation $\mathcal{R}^\gamma$, such that $N^\gamma_{t^\gamma} \entails
\gamma$. Without loss of generality we assume that the $N^\gamma$ are disjoint.

Let $t$ be a state not in $S^M$ or any of the $S^{N^\gamma}$. Then we construct a
Kripke model $N = (S^N, R^N, V^N)$ where:
\begin{eqnarray*}
S^N &=& \{t\} \cup S^M \cup \bigcup_{\gamma \in \Gamma} S^{N^\gamma}\\
R^N_a &=& \{(t, t^\gamma) \mid \gamma \in \Gamma\}
\cup R^M_a
\cup \bigcup_{\gamma \in \Gamma} R^{N^\gamma}_a\\
R^N_b &=& \{(t, t') \mid t' \in sR^M_b\}
\cup R^M_b
\cup \bigcup_{\gamma \in \Gamma} R^{N^\gamma}_b \text{ for $b \in A - \{a\}$}\\
V^N(p) &=& 
\begin{cases}
\displaystyle \{t\} \cup V^M(p) \cup \bigcup_{\gamma \in \Gamma} V^{N^\gamma}(p) & \text{if $s
\in V^M(p)$}\\
\displaystyle V^M(p) \cup \bigcup_{\gamma \in \Gamma} V^{N^\gamma}(p) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\text{ for $p \in P$}
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center} % TODO - better diagram
\scalebox{0.4}{
\includegraphics{rk}
}
\caption{
The model $N$ is constructed by taking the model $M$ and the models $N^\gamma$
for every $\gamma \in \Gamma$, and connecting them with an extra node $t$. $t$
is connected via an $a$-edge to $t^\gamma$ from each of the $N^\gamma$, and is
also connected via a $b$-edge to each $b$-successor of $s$ in $M$.
}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

We construct an $a$-simulation $\mathcal{R}$ from $N_t$ to $M_s$, where:
$$\mathcal{R} = \{(t, s)\} \cup \{(s', s') \mid s' \in S^M \} 
\cup \bigcup_{\gamma \in \Gamma} \mathcal{R}^\gamma$$

We must show that $\mathcal{R}$ satisfies {\bf atoms}, {\bf forth-$b$} for every
$b \in A$, and {\bf back-$b$} for every $b \in A - \{a\}$.

\paragraph{atoms} We note that, by construction, the valuation of $N$ matches
the valuation of its corresponding states in $M$ and each $N^\gamma$, and the
valuation of $N_t$ matches that of $M_s$. Therefore $\mathcal{R}$ satisfies {\bf
atoms}.

\paragraph{forth} We next show that $\mathcal{R}$ satisfies {\bf forth-$b$} for
every $b \in A$.  Let $b \in A$ and let $(u, v) \in \mathcal{R}$.

Suppose that $(u, v) \in \mathcal{R}^\gamma$ for some $\gamma \in \Gamma$.  Then
as $\mathcal{R}^\gamma$ is an $a$-simulation, it satisfies {\bf forth-$b$} for
every $b \in A$. Hence for every $u' \in uR^{N^\gamma}_b = uR^N_b$, there exists
some $v' \in vR^M_b$ such that $(u', v') \in \mathcal{R}^\gamma \subseteq
\mathcal{R}$. 

Suppose instead that $(u, v) = (s', s')$ for some $s' \in S^M$.  Then we note
that $s'R^N_b = s'R^M_b$, and hence for every $s'' \in s'R^N_b$ we have that
$s'' \in s'R^M_b$, and that $(s'', s'') \in \mathcal{R}$. 

Finally suppose that $(u, u') = (t, s)$. We must consider the cases where $b =
a$ and where $b \neq a$. So suppose that $b = a$. By construction, $tR^N_a =
\{t^\gamma \mid \gamma \in \Gamma\}$, and hence $v = t^\gamma$ for some $\gamma
\in \Gamma$. Hence we can take $s^\gamma \in sR^M_a$, and note that as
$\mathcal{R}^\gamma$ is an $a$-simulation from $M_{s^\gamma}$ to
$N^\gamma_{t^\gamma}$, we know that $(t^\gamma, s^\gamma) \in \mathcal{R}^\gamma
\subseteq \mathcal{R}$. Suppose that $b \neq a$. Then by construction, $tR^M_b =
sR^M_b$, hence for every $t' \in tR^M_b$, we have that $t' \in sR^M_b$, and
hence we know that $(t', t') \in \mathcal{R}$. 

Therefore $\mathcal{R}$ satisfies {\bf forth-$b$} for every $b \in A$.

\paragraph{back} A similar argument to above shows that $\mathcal{R}$
satisfies {\bf back-$a$} for every $b \in A - \{a\}$.

Therefore $\mathcal{R}$ is an $a$-simulation, and $N_t \refinement_a M_s$.

Finally we show that $N_t \entails \covers_a \Gamma$. We must show that for each
$\gamma \in \Gamma$ that $N_{t^\gamma} \entails \gamma$. This follows from the
fact that $N_{t^\gamma}$ is bisimilar to $N^\gamma_{t^\gamma}$. This is obvious,
as $N$ contains a duplicate of $N^\gamma$, and $N$ does not add any additional
edges originating from states in $S^{N^\gamma}$. Hence from bisimulation
invariance, $N_{t^\gamma} \entails \gamma$ for every $\gamma \in \Gamma$, and
hence $N_t \entails \covers_a \Gamma$.

As $N_t \refinement_a M_s$, and $N_t \entails \covers_a \Gamma$ we therefore
have that $M_s \entails \somerefs_a \covers_a \Gamma$.

Conversely, suppose that $M_s \entails \covers_a \Gamma$. Then there exists a
Kripke model $N_t \refinement_a M_s$, via some $a$-simulation $\mathcal{R}$,
such that $N_t \entails \covers_a \Gamma$. From the definition of the cover
operator, this implies that $N_t \entails \knows_a \bigvee_{\gamma \in \Gamma}
\gamma \land \bigwedge_{\gamma \in \Gamma} \suspects_a \gamma$. In particular we
note that for every $\gamma \in \Gamma$, $N_t \entails \suspects_a \gamma$, and
so there exists some $t^\gamma \in tR^N_a$ such that $N_{t^\gamma} \entails
\gamma$. As $t^\gamma \in tR^N_a$, and $(t, s) \in \mathcal{R}$, by {\bf
forth-$a$} there exists some $s^\gamma \in sR^M_a$ such that $(t^\gamma, s^\gamma)
\in \mathcal{R}$. Hence $\mathcal{R}$ is also an $a$-simulation from
$N_{t^\gamma}$ to $M_{s^\gamma}$, and so $M_{s^\gamma} \entails \somerefs_a
\gamma$. As for every $\gamma \in \Gamma$ we have that $s^\gamma \in sR^M_a$, we
also have that $M_s \entails \suspects_a \somerefs_a \gamma$. Therefore we
finally have that $M_s \entails \bigwedge_{\gamma \in \Gamma} \suspects_a
\somerefs_a \gamma$.

Therefore {\bf RK} is sound.

\paragraph{RComm}
Suppose that $M_s \in \classK$ is a Kripke model such that $M_s \entails
\covers_b \{ \somerefs_a \gamma \mid \gamma \in \Gamma\}$, where $a \neq b$.

We need to show that $M_s \entails \somerefs_a \covers_b \Gamma$. To do this we
follow the same strategy as for proving {\bf RK}: we construct an $a$-refinement
$N_t \in \classK$, and show that $N_t \entails \covers_b \Gamma$.

We begin by constructing the model $N_t$. Consider $\gamma \in \Gamma$. From
$M_s \entails \covers_b \{ \somerefs_a \gamma \mid \gamma \in \Gamma \}$, there
exists a state $s^\gamma \in sR^M_b$ such that $M_{s^\gamma} \entails
\somerefs_a \gamma$. Therefore there exists a Kripke model $N^\gamma_{t^\gamma}
\refinement_a M_{s^\gamma}$, via some $a$-simulation $\mathcal{R}^\gamma$, such
that $N^\gamma_{t^\gamma} \entails \gamma$. Without loss of generality we assume
that the $N^\gamma$ are disjoint.

Let $t$ be a state not in $S^M$ or any of the $S^{N^\gamma}$. Then we construct a
Kripke model $N = (S^N, R^N, V^N)$ where:
\begin{eqnarray*}
S^N &=& \{t\} \cup S^M \bigcup_{\gamma \in \Gamma} S^{N^\gamma}\\
R^N_b &=& \{(t, t^\gamma) \mid \gamma \in \Gamma\} 
\cup  R^M_b 
\cup \bigcup_{\gamma \in \Gamma} R^{N^\gamma}_b\\
R^N_c &=& \{(t, t') \mid t' \in sR^M_c\} 
\cup R^M_c \cup \bigcup_{\gamma \in \Gamma} R^{N^\gamma}_c \text{ for $c \in A - \{b\}$}\\
V^N(p) &=& 
\begin{cases}
\displaystyle \{t\} \cup V^M(p) \cup \bigcup_{\gamma \in \Gamma} V^{N^\gamma}(p)
& \text{if $s \in V^M(p)$}\\
\displaystyle V^M(p) \cup \bigcup_{\gamma \in \Gamma} V^{N^\gamma}(p) &
\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\text{ for $p \in P$}
\end{eqnarray*}

We construct an $a$-simulation $\mathcal{R}$ from $N_t$ to $M_s$, where:
$$\mathcal{R} = \{(t, s)\} \cup \{(s', s') \mid s' \in S^M\} \cup
\bigcup_{\gamma \in \Gamma} \mathcal{R}^\gamma$$

We note that $\mathcal{R}$ is an $a$-simulation, by similar arguments as used in
the proof for {\bf RK}. In particular, this means that $N_t \refinement_a M_s$.

We also note that for every $\gamma \in \Gamma$, that $N_{t^\gamma} \entails
\gamma$, by similar arguments as used in the proof for {\bf RK}. In particular,
this means that $N^\gamma_t \entails \covers_b \Gamma$.

Therefore $M_s \entails \somerefs_a \covers_b \Gamma$.

The converse, $\somerefs_a \covers_b \Gamma \implies \covers_b \{\somerefs_a
\gamma \mid \gamma \in \Gamma\}$ follows a similar proof to the relevant part in
the proof for {\bf RK}.

Therefore {\bf RComm} is sound.

\paragraph{RDist}
Suppose that $M_s \in \classK$ is a Kripke model such that $M_s \entails
\bigwedge_{b \in B} \somerefs_a \covers_b \Gamma_b$, where $B \subseteq A$.

We need to show that $M_s \entails \somerefs_a \bigwedge_{b \in B} \covers_b
\Gamma_b$. To do this we follow the same strategy as for proving {\bf RK}: we
construct an $a$-refinement $N_t \in \classK$, and show that $N_t \entails
\somerefs_a \bigwedge_{b \in B} \covers_b \Gamma_b$.

We begin by constructing the model $N_t$. Suppose that $a \in B$. Then we have
$M_s \entails \somerefs_a \covers_a \Gamma_a$, and by {\bf RK} this implies that
$M_s \entails \bigwedge_{\gamma \in \Gamma_a} \gamma$. We also have that for
every $b \in B - \{a\}$ that $M_s \entails \somerefs_a \covers_a \Gamma_b$, and
by {\bf RComm} this implies that $M_s \entails \covers_b \{\somerefs_a \gamma
\mid \gamma \in \Gamma_b\}$, and by the definition of the cover operator, this
implies that $M_s \entails \bigwedge_{\gamma \in \Gamma_b} \suspects_b
\somerefs_a \gamma$. Hence for every $b \in B$ and $\gamma \in \Gamma_b$, we
have that $\suspects_b \somerefs_a \gamma$. This implies that for each $b \in B$
and each $\gamma \in \Gamma_b$ that there exists some $s^{b,\gamma} \in sR^M_b$ such
that $M_{s^{a,\gamma}} \entails \somerefs_a \gamma$. Therefore there exists a Kripke
model $N^{b,\gamma}_{t^{b,\gamma}} \refinement_a M_{s^{a,\gamma}}$ such that
$N^{b,\gamma}_{t^{b,\gamma}} \entails \gamma$. Without loss of generality we
may assume that the $N^{b,\gamma}$ are disjoint.

Let $t$ be a state not in $S^M$ or any of the $S^{N^{b,\gamma}}$. Then we construct a
Kripke model $N = (S^N, R^N, V^N)$ where:
\begin{eqnarray*}
S^N &=& \{t\} \cup S^M \cup \bigcup_{b \in A, \gamma \in \Gamma_b} S^{N^{b,\gamma}}\\
R^N_b &=& \{(t, t^{b,\gamma}) \mid \gamma \in \Gamma_b\} \cup R^M_b \cup
\bigcup_{c \in B, \gamma \in \Gamma_c} R^{N^{c,\gamma}}_b \text{ for $b \in
B$}\\
R^N_b &=& \{(t, t') \mid t' \in sR^M_b\} \cup R^M_b \cup
\bigcup_{c \in B, \gamma \in \Gamma_c} R^{N^{c,\gamma}}_b \text{ for $b \in A
\setminus B$}\\
V^N(p) &=& 
\begin{cases}
\displaystyle \{t\} \cup V^M(p) \cup \bigcup_{b \in B, \gamma \in \Gamma_b}
V^{N^{b,\gamma}}(p) & \text{if $s \in V^M(p)$}\\
\displaystyle V^M(p) \cup \bigcup_{b \in B, \gamma \in \Gamma_b}
V^{N^{b,\gamma}}(p) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{eqnarray*}

We construct an $a$-simulation $\mathcal{R}$ from $N_t$ to $M_s$, where:
$$\mathcal{R} = \{(t, s)\} \cup \{(s', s') \mid s' \in S^M\} \bigcup_{b \in A,
\gamma \in \Gamma_b} \mathcal{R}^\gamma$$

We note that this is an $a$-simulation, by similar arguments as used in the
proof for {\bf RK}. In particular, this means that $N_t \refinement_a M_s$.

We also note that for every $b \in A$, and $\gamma \in \Gamma_b$ that
$N_{t^\gamma} \bisim N^\gamma_{t^\gamma}$, by similar arguments as used in the
proof for {\bf RK}. In particular, this means that as $N^\gamma_{t^\gamma}
\entails \gamma$ that we also have $N_{t^\gamma} \entails \gamma$, for every $b
\in A$ and $\gamma \in \Gamma_b$. Therefore $N_t \entails \covers_b \Gamma_b$
for every $b \in A$, and therefore $N_t \entails \bigwedge_{b \in A} \covers_b
\Gamma_b$.

Therefore $M_s \entails \somerefs_a \bigwedge_{b \in A} \covers_b \Gamma_b$ and
{\bf RDist} is sound.

Therefore the axiomatisation \axiomKF{} is sound.
\end{proof}

We note that if the implication in {\bf RDist} is strengthened to an equality,
that the resulting axiom is also sound. However this is easily derivable from
the other axioms in \axiomKF{}.

\begin{lemma}\label{k-rdist-converse}
The following is derivable in \axiomKF{}.
$$
\proves \bigwedge_{b \in A} \somerefs_a \covers_b \Gamma_b \iff
\somerefs_a \bigwedge_{b \in A} \covers_b \Gamma_b \\
$$
where $\Gamma_b$ is a set of $b$-disjunctive normal formulae for
every $b \in A$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}[Proof (Sketch)]
The forward direction is the axiom {\bf RDist}. 

The converse can be derived in a more general form as $\somerefs_a (\phi \land
\psi) \implies \somerefs_a \phi \land \somerefs_a \psi$. The derivation is
similar to the derivation for $\knows_a (\phi \land \psi) \implies \knows_a \phi
\land \knows_a \psi$ in the modal logic \logicK{}, using the axiom {\bf R} in
place of {\bf K}.
\end{proof}

We show the completeness of the axiomatisation \axiomKF{} by a provably correct
translation from \langF{} to \lang{}. Completeness then follows from the
completeness of \logicK{}.

We introduce some equivalences that will be used by our translation.

\begin{lemma}\label{k-equivalences}
The following are provable equivalences using \axiomKF{}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\displaystyle \somerefs_a (\phi \lor \psi) \iff
\somerefs_a \phi \lor \somerefs_a \psi$
\item $\displaystyle \somerefs_a (\pi \land \bigwedge_{b
\in B} \covers_b \Gamma_b) \iff \pi \land \bigwedge_{\gamma \in \Gamma_a}

\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
(1) is derivable from {\bf P} and {\bf R} using the same strategy used to prove
that $\suspects_a (\phi \lor \psi) \iff \suspects_a \phi \lor \suspects_a \psi$
is derivable from {\bf P} and {\bf K}.

(2) and (3) are derivable, by using {\bf P}, {\bf R} and {\bf RP} to bring the
propositional part $\pi$ outside the $\somerefs_a$ operator, using {\bf RDist}

$\somerefs_a$ operator into the cover operators inside the conjunction, and then
using {\bf RK} or {\bf RComm} as appropriate for each cover operator.

\begin{lemma}\label{k-translation}
Every formula of \langF{} is provably equivalent to a formula of \lang{} with
the axiomatisation \axiomKF{}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $\alpha \in \langF{}$. We prove by induction on the number of occurrences of
\somerefs{} in $\alpha$ that $\alpha$ is equivalent to a \somerefs{}-free
formula, and therefore to a formula in \lang{}. The base case where $\alpha$
contains no \somerefs{} operators is trivial, as a \somerefs{}-free formula is a
formula in \lang{}. Suppose instead that $\alpha$ contains $n + 1$ \somerefs{}
operators, and assume that any formula with $n$ \somerefs{} operators is
provably equivalent to a formula in \lang{}. We use the axioms of \axiomKF{} to
show that $\alpha$ is provably equivalent to a formula with $n$ \somerefs{}
operators, and that therefore by the induction hypothesis it is provably
equivalent to a formula in \lang{}.

Choose a subformula from $\alpha$ of type $\somerefs_a \beta$, where $\beta$ is
\somerefs{}-free. Without loss of generality, by Lemma~\ref{k-dnf} we may assue
that $\beta$ is in disjunctive normal form. We prove by induction on the
structure of $\beta$ that $\somerefs_a \beta$ is provably equivalent to a
formula $\chi \in \lang$. The induction hypothesis is that for any proper
subformula of $\beta$ that $\somerefs_a \beta$ is equivalent to a formula in
\lang{}.

The base case is when $\beta$ is a propositional formula. In this case, from
{\bf P} and {\bf RP}, we have that $\somerefs_a \beta \iff \beta$, and therefore
$\somerefs_a \beta$ is equivalent to a formula in \lang{}. 

The inductive case is when $\beta = \phi \lor \psi$, or when $\beta = \pi \land
\bigwedge_{b \in B} \covers_b \Gamma_b$, where $B \subseteq A$. We note that we
can use the equivalences from Lemma~\ref{k-equivalences} to push the $\somerefs_a$
operator inside so that it is applied to subformulae of $\beta$. We can then use
the induction hypothesis to replace each occurrence of the $\somerefs_a$
operator applied to a subformula of $\beta$ with an equivalent formula in
\lang{}. The resulting formula is also in \lang{}.

Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, $\somerefs_a \beta$ is
equivalent to a formula in $\chi \in \lang{}$ for every $\beta \in \lang{}$. 

Hence replacing $\somerefs_a \beta$ in $\alpha$ with $\chi$ gives a formula
equivalent to $\alpha$ that contains only $n$ \somerefs operators.

Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, $\alpha$ is equivalent to
a formula in \lang{}.
\end{proof}

The rest of the completeness proof is merely a formality to show that, given the
above translation into \lang{}, we can show completeness by using these
translations along with the completeness of \logicK{}.

\begin{corollary}\label{k-derivable}
Let $\phi \in \langF$ be given and $\psi \in \lang$ be semantically
equivalent to $\phi$.  If $\psi$ is a theorem in \logicK{}, then $\phi$ is a
theorem in \axiomKF{}.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Let $\phi \in \langF$ and let $\psi \in \lang$ be semantically equivalent to
$\phi$. By Lemma~\ref{k-translation}, we can obtain some $\phi' \in \lang$
that is semantically equivalent to $\phi$ (and thus also to $\psi$) by following
the given translation steps. We can extend a derivation of $\psi$ to a
derivation of $\phi'$ as the two are semantically equivalent in \logicK{}, and by
the completeness of \logicK{} this equivalence is derivable. As \axiomKF{} is a
conservative extension of \logicK{}, this equivalence is therefore also derivable
in \axiomKF{}. The derivation can be further extended to $\phi$ by observing that all
of the reduction steps in Lemma~\ref{k-translation} are provable equivalences
in \axiomKF{}. Therefore $\phi$ is a theorem in \axiomKF{}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{k-complete}
The axiom schema \axiomKF{} is complete for the logic \logicKF{}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $\phi \in \langF$ such that $\classK \entails_\somerefs \phi$. Then by
Lemma~\ref{k-translation}, there exists a semantically equivalent formula
$\psi \in \lang$ which is \somerefs-free. As $\classK \entails_\somerefs \phi$ and
$\phi \iff \psi$, then $\classK \entails_\somerefs \psi$. As $\psi$ is
\somerefs-free, then it follows that $\classK \entails \psi$, and by the
completeness of \axiomKF{} it follows that $\proves_{\axiomK} \psi$.
Therefore by Corollary~\ref{k-derivable} we have that $\proves_{\axiomKF}
\phi$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
The axiomatisation \axiomKF{} is sound and complete for the logic \logicKF{}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The soundness proof is given in Lemma~\ref{k-sound} and the completeness
proof is given in Lemma~\ref{k-complete}.
\end{proof}
