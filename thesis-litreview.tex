\chapter{Literature review}

We review previous techniques for modelling information change in epistemic
logic and doxastic logic, and previous work in the refinement quantified modal
logic, that motivates the present work.

\section{Information change in epistemic logics}

Dynamic epistemic logic is a general term for the study of information change in
modal epistemic systems. Information change is performed by informative updates,
events that provide agents with additional information, whilst leaving factual
information about the state of the world unchanged. Notable representations for
informative updates in dynamic epistemic logic include {\em public
announcements} and {\em action models}. I will briefly discuss these
representations of informative updates, and the logics that have been devised to
reason about them.

\subsection{Public announcements}

A public announcement is a simple form of informative update, where a true
statement is announced to all agents in a system at
once~\cite{vanditmarsch2007dynamic}.  A public announcement takes the form of an
epistemic formula $\phi$. As $\phi$ is announced to all agents at once, one
result of the announcement is that afterwards every agent knows that $\phi$ is
the case. However in addition to this, as the announcement was made publically,
every agent also knows that every other agent knows that $\phi$, and also that
every agent knows this, and so on ad infinitum.  Effectively $\phi$ becomes
common knowledge amongst all of the agents. In terms of the Kripke model
representation of the epistemic system, a public announcement has the effect of
restricting the states of the Kripke model to those states that are consistent
with $\phi$, as given the additional information that $\phi$ is the case, those
states that are inconsistent with $\phi$ are now considered inplausible by every
agent.

The public announcement logic was axiomatised by Plaza~\cite{plaza2007logics},
and also independently by by Gerbrandy and
Groenvald~\cite{gerbrandy1997reasoning}.  The logic introduces an operator
$[\alpha]$, where $\alpha$ is an epistemic formula, that can be used to reason
about the results of a specific public announcement. The operator, $[\alpha]
\phi$ means that after the formula $\alpha$ is publicly announced, $\phi$ holds
in the resulting epistemic state. This allows one to reason about the
consequences of specific public announcements in the epistemic system.

Public announcements are a very limited form of informative update, because the
information contained in a public announcement necessarily becomes common
knowledge to all agents in the system. Public announcements cannot for example
model informative updates that provide information privately to only some of
the agents in the system. Public announcements are however suited to some
interesting problems, for example the muddy children puzzle that was discussed
in the introduction to this paper~\cite{vanditmarsch2007dynamic}.

\subsection{Action models}

Action models capture a more general notion of informative updates than public
announcements. Compared to public announcements, action models are able to
represent informative updates that provide information to only a subset of the
agents, or where an agent may be aware that one of several possible informative
updates has occurred, but is uncertain as to which update actually occurred. 

For example, we may have a situation where we have two agents, $a$ and $b$,
where neither agent knows whether a proposition $p$ is true or false, and
moreover, both agents know about the other's ignorance. Suppose that $a$ is told
privately that $p$ is actually true, whilst $b$ is aware that $a$ has been told
something, but does not actually know what $a$ was told. Then a result of this
is that $a$ now knows $p$ is true, whilst $b$ does not. Thus the effect of the
informative update is that only one agent was provided with the additional
information. Furthermore, $b$ is aware that an informative update has occurred,
but is uncertain as to which update actually occurred. From the point of view of
$b$, $a$ may have been told that $p$ is true, or that $p$ is false, or $a$ may
have been told nothing at all. A result of this is that, whilst $b$ knew that
$a$ was ignorant to the truth of $p$ before the informative update, after the
informative update $b$ no longer has this knowledge.

Action models are represented by relational structures, similar to Kripke
models~\cite{vanditmarsch2007dynamic}. An action model is executed on a Kripke
model, resulting in a new Kripke model. If the action model is said to represent
an informative update, then the new Kripke model represents the resulting
knowledge state after the informative update has been performed.

The logic of action models was introduced by Baltag, Solecki and
Moss~\cite{baltag2004logics}. Again, an operator is introduced that has the
effect of performing an informative update, this time in the form of executing
an action model on the Kripke model that represents the current epistemic
state.  The operator, $[\mathrm{M,s}]\psi$ means that after the action model
$(\mathrm{M, s})$ is executed in the current epistemic state, $\psi$ holds in
the resulting epistemic state. 

Epistemic actions are a similar representation of informative updates.
van
Ditmarsch~\cite{vanditmarsch1999logic,vanditmarsch2001knowledge,vanditmarsch2007dynamic}
introduced the logic of epistemic actions, a logic similar to the logic of
action models. The difference between epistemic actions and action models is
that an epistemic action is represented as a formula instead of as a relational
structure. The formula may contain operators whose purpose is to limit the
effect of informative updates to a certain subset of agents, or to give the
effect that one of several informative updates may have taken place, but from
the point of view of some of the agents, which update has actually occurred is
unclear. This can be compared to a public announcement, which is also
represented as a formula.

\subsection{Arbitrary public announcement logic}

Balbiani, Baltag, van Ditmarsch, et al.~\cite{balbiani2007arbitrary} introduced
the arbitrary public announcement logic, extension of the public announcement
logic, that provides an operator for quantifying over arbitrary public
announcements. It introduces an operator, $\Box\psi$, which means that after
any arbitrary public announcement, $\psi$ holds. Its dual operator,
$\Diamond\psi$ means that after some public announcement, $\psi$ holds.

The same paper briefly discusses a possible arbitrary action model logic, a
generalisation of arbitrary public announcement logic allowing for any kind of
informative update, modelled as the execution of an action model. French and
van Ditmarsch~\cite{french2008undecidability} later showed that the arbitrary
public announcement was undecidable. Whilst the arbitrary action model logic has
not been considered in depth, the undecidability result in arbitrary public
announcement logic has encouraged research into weaker versions of this logic
instead, as they are more likely to be decidable.

\section{Information change in doxastic logics}

In dynamic epistemic logic, we consider how knowledge changes in response to
informative updates that provide agents with additional information. A key
property of epistemic systems is that everything that an agent knows must be
true, and any information that an agent is provided must also be true. A
consequence of this is that once agents have gained certain information, they do
not lose this information; further informative updates cannot cause the agent to
forget past information, or to reconsider the truth of previous statements. By
contrast, in doxastic systems, the beliefs that an agent holds do not
necessarily have to be true, and the information that agents are given also do
not have to be true. Therefore it is reasonable for an agent to reconsider its
beliefs, and possibly reject past information, if it is provided with new
information that contradicts its old beliefs. We will briefly discuss {\em
belief revision}, which models the revision and possible removal of old beliefs,
and {\em action models}, which can be generalised from epistemic systems to
doxastic systems.

\subsection{Belief revision}

The AGM approach to belief revision, named for Alchourrón, Gärdenfors and
Makinson~\cite{alchourron1985logic}, who did much of the initial work in this
area, considers the beliefs of an agent as a set of propositional formulae,
called the belief set, that the agent believes to be true. Informative updates
are represented by an operation on the belief set, called a {\em revision},
wherein a new propositional formula is incorporated into the belief set, and the
existing beliefs are revised to accommodate it. The process of belief revision
involves adding the new information to the belief set, whilst rejecting existing
beliefs that may contradict with the new information. Revision can be defined as
an operation over a set of propositional formulae, and so reasoning about belief
revision can be done directly in these terms. Dynamic doxastic logic is a logic
similar to the previously discussed public announcement logics, and action model
logics, which introduces an operator for reasoning about the result of an
informative update in terms of belief revision~\cite{vanditmarsch2007dynamic}.
Variants of dynamic doxastic logic use different operators for belief revision.
Segerberg~\cite{segerberg2001basic} provided axiomatisation for some variants of
dynamic doxastic logics.

\subsection{Action models}

The same system of action models for modelling informative updates in epistemic
models can be generalised to apply to doxastic
models~\cite{vanditmarsch2007dynamic}. Unlike action models applied in the
epistemic setting, action models applied in the doxastic setting do not
necessarily have to represent a truthful informative update, so it is possible
for agents to come to believe statements that are not actually true.  By
contrast to belief revision, it is not possible for action models to cause an
agent to reject past information. In effect, once an agent has been provided
with information, it is committed to believe that information forever.

\section{Other related logics}

\subsection{Group announcement logics}

The group announcement logic, introduced by {\AA}gotnes et
al.~\cite{agotnes2010group} is an extension of public announcement logic that
allows one to reason about whether a group of agents within an epistemic system
are able to cooperate in order to bring about some knowledge state. The agents
in the group are able to cooperate by publicly announcing statements that the
agents know, but are unable to announce statements that they do not know. The
logic introduces an operator, $<G>$, where $G$ is a subset of the agents, and
the formula $<G> \phi$ means that there is some set of formulae, such every
formula is known by at least one of the agents, and such that after each agent
announces the formulae that they know, $\phi$ is true in the resulting
knowledge state. {\AA}gotnes et al.~\cite{agotnes2010group} provide a sound and
complete axiomatisation of the group announcement logic, show that it is
decidable, and give complexity and expressivity results for the logic. Notably,
the group announcement logic is not as expressive as the arbitrary public
announcement logic, and it is conjectured that the arbitrary public
announcement is not as expressive as the group announcement logic either.  The
difference between group announcement logic and the arbitrary public
announcement logic is that the group announcement logic essentially quantifies
over the public announcements that the agents in the group know, whereas the
arbitrary public announcement logic quantifies over all possible public
announcements.

\subsection{Propositional dynamic logics}

Propositional dynamic logic is a variant of dynamic logic, first introduced by
Fischer and Ladner~\cite{fischer1979propositional}. Propositional dynamic logic
is a logic that introduces a concept of performing an action, called a program,
on a modal state. The programs in propositional dynamic logic are symbolic in
nature, and do not have any inherent effect on the model that it is performed
on. Programs can be combined, by composition, repetition, concurrent execution
or by including a test, where an action is performed only if a particular
formula is satisfied at the current state. Actions are performed using modal
operators that are labelled with the actions themselves; hence there is a modal
operator for every possible action. What differentiates propositional dynamic
logics from standard modal logics is that the models under consideration have
algebraic constraints on them, which preserve certain properties about the
composition of programs, amongst other properties. Propositional dynamic logic
is decidable, and has decision procedures which have an exponential running time
in the worst case~\cite{pratt1980near}.

van Benthem, van Eijck and Kooi~\cite{vanbenthem2006logics} showed that the
action model logic can be translated to propositional dynamic logic, and hence
propositional dynamic logic is at least as expressive as the action model logic.
Miller and Moss however showed that adding quantification over action models, as
in arbitrary action model logic, makes the logic
undecidable~\cite{miller2005undecidability}.

\subsection{Description logics}

Description logics are logics used for knowledge representation, often used in
applications involving ontologies, such as artificial intelligence or the
Semantic Web. Description logics are similar to modal logics, in the sense that
they are designed to be decidable fragments of first-order logic, and in fact
many description logics are simply syntactic variations of modal
logics~\cite{blackburn2002modal}. Dynamic description logics, a hybrid of
propositional dynamic logics and description logics have been considered by
Wolter and Zakharyaschev~\cite{wolter1998dynamic}. Wolter and Zakharyaschev
extended the description logic $\mathcal{ALC}$, which is a syntactic variation of
the modal logic \logicK{}, with propositional dynamic operators, provided an
axiomatisation for the resulting logic and showed that it was decidable.

\subsection{Bisimulation quantified modal logics}

Bisimulations are a related notion to refinements over Kripke models. Whilst a
refinement is a pre-order relation defined over Kripke models, a bisimulation
can be seen as essentially the equivalence relation that is naturally formed
from the refinement relation. Bisimulation quantified modal logics extend modal
logics with an operator for quantifying over the models that are bisimilar to
the Kripke model under consideration, but where a particular propositional atom
may vary in its interpretation. In effect it is quantifying over the truth value
of a propositional variable, in models bisimilar to the current Kripke model.
French~\cite{french2006bisimulation} considered a number of bisimulation
quantified modal logics, and provided axiomatisations and decidability or
undecidability results for several such logics.

\section{Refinement quantified modal logics}

van Ditmarsch and French~\cite{french2009simulation} introduced the future event
logic, an extension of epistemic logic that provides an operator for
quantification over arbitrary refinements of Kripke models. van Ditmarsch and
French provided the semantics of the logic, and several results and comparisons
to justify the future event logic as accurately capturing the notion of
quantifying over arbitrary informative updates. van Ditmarsch and French also
compare the semantics of the future event logic to previously defined logics, in
particular to the bisimulation quantified epistemic logic, and to the proposed
arbitrary action model logic. In this paper we refer to the future event logic
with the more general term of refinement quantified modal logics. The future
event logic that van Ditmarsch and French initially introduced is the epistemic
variant, the refinement quantified epistemic logic.

The refinement quantified modal logics are related to the bisimulation
quantified modal logics, as refinement as bisimulations are related concepts.
The refinement quantifier can be viewed as a weaker version of the bisimulation
quantifiers in bisimulation quantified modal logics~\cite{french2009simulation}.
However the two logics have completely different interpretations and
applications with respect to epistemic logic.

van Ditmarsch and French compare the refinement quantified epistemic logic to
the proposed arbitrary action model logic~\cite{french2009simulation}. The main
difference between the two logics is that the refinement quantified epistemic
logic does not include an operator for reasoning about the results of a specific
informative update. van Ditmarsch and French~\cite{french2009simulation} show
that if such an operator is added to the refinement quantified epistemic logic,
then the resulting logic is equivalent to the arbitrary action model logic. The
semantics of the refinement quantifier in the refinement quantified epistemic
logic are much simpler than the semantics of the action model quantifier in
arbitrary action model logic, as they do not rely on the mechanics of action
models.

Although not considered in detail by van Ditmarsch and French, we compare the
related refinement quantified doxastic logic to previously defined notions of
information change in doxastic logics. The refinement quantified epistemic logic
quantifies over the refinements of Kripke models, which are equivalent to the
execution of arbitrary action models on the Kripke
model~\cite{french2009simulation}. A consequence of this in the doxastic setting
is that the notion of information change that the refinement quantified doxastic
logic captures is closer to that of the action models that we have discussed
earlier, rather than belief revision. In particular, this means that agents are
committed to believing information after it has been provided to them, and that
it is not possible for agents to reject information that they have previously
been provided.

The refinement quantified modal logic is considered in more depth by van
Ditmarsch, French and Pinchinat~\cite{french2010future}. They consider the
single-agent modal variant of the logic, rather than the epistemic variant. An
axiomatisation of the logic is provided, and is proven sound and complete. The
soundness proof for the axiomatisation is performed via a provably correct
translation to single-agent modal logic. This translation shows that the
single-agent refinement quantified modal logic is expressively equivalent to the
single-agent modal logic. This expressivity result gives us several results
about the single-agent refinement quantified modal logic from properties of
basic modal logic, in particular that the single-agent refinement quantified
modal logic is decidable. van Ditmarsch, French and Pinchinat also provide an
explicit decision procedure for the logic, that runs in 2EXP time, using a
tableau method, which gives an upper bound for the complexity of the logic. The
refinement quantified modal logic is also shown to be exponentially more
succinct than the basic modal logic, a result that hints that the decision
procedure that was given is likely to be optimal. Extending the refinement
quantified modal logic to the multi-agent cases, and to epistemic and doxastic
variants, are left as future work.
